# Developer Notes

## Technical Decisions

### Why Laravel?
- Robust MVC framework with excellent documentation
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Eloquent ORM for database management
- Large community support

### Database Design
- Events table with relationships to Users
- Booking system with pivot tables
- Admin role implementation

### Deployment Strategy
- Railway for easy deployment and scaling
- MySQL database in production
- Environment-based configuration

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

1. **Image Storage**: Initially used Laravel storage, switched to public directory for easier Railway deployment
2. **Route Conflicts**: Resolved by proper route ordering (specific before dynamic)
3. **Pagination**: Implemented 4 events per page for optimal UX

## Future Improvements

- Add payment integration
- Email notifications for bookings
- Event calendar view
- Social media sharing
- Event reviews and ratings
